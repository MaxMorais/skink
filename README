Introduction
------------

skink is a Continuous Integration server that's as simple as it gets. 

Specify a git repository, a shell command to execute 
to build your project and that's pretty much it.

Just ask skink to run your build and it will update your code, run a build
and keep track of your build history.

You can create a git hook to auto-execute the build upon push as well.
