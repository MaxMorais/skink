Introduction
------------

skink is a Continuous Integration server that's as simple as it gets. 

Specify a git repository, a shell command to execute 
to build your project and that's pretty much it.

Just ask skink to run your build and it will update your code, run a build
and keep track of your build history.

You can create a git hook to auto-execute the build upon push as well.

Project Naming
--------------
The name for the project comes from the "Plestiodon skiltonianus" or Western Skink (http://www.wildherps.com/species/E.skiltonianus.html).

This very beautiful reptile keeps moving constantly, just like the skink server does.

Skinkize your project right now! Keep moving!
