#Skink continuous integration server

Skink is a Continuous Integration server that's as simple as it gets. 

##Version 3.0.0

Skink's going to be fully rebuilt using [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org), a powerful Python tool powered by Facebook.

##Project Naming

The name for the project comes from the "Plestiodon skiltonianus" or Western Skink - <http://www.wildherps.com/species/E.skiltonianus.html>.

This very beautiful reptile keeps moving constantly, just like the skink server does.

Skinkize your project right now! Keep moving!

##Project website

We are going to relaunch Skink's website at <http://skinkci.org>.
